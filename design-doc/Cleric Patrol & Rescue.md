# Background:
You are a cleric on a pilgrimage through a dungeon to find the secret sauce.  During your pilgrimage, you may come across many adventurers who found themselves in a compromising positions against the various hazards of the dungeon.   Luckily, your temple has taught you how to perform CPR, and you have just enough magic to deliver a small shock to hopefully restart a heart from cardiac arrest.

# Overview

## stage 1
* [ ] Level select
* [ ] each level immediately transitions to where the victim is stuck
* [ ] the player mashes a button to fills up progress bar(s)
	* [ ] which interpolates the animation to free the victim from the hazards
	* hazard ideas:
		* mimic
		* slime
		* crevice (step bro I'm stuck)
## stage 2
* [ ] victim now takes damage based on time stuck in hazard.
* [ ] Once freed, player is presented with the following options:
* [ ] Check for response
	- [ ] if victim is responsive, they will thank you
- [ ] Check breathing
	- [ ] hold the button to close your eyes and focus on the sound from the victim
	- [ ] if victim is responsive, they will ask what you're doing, but will thank you anyways
- Resuscitate
	- [ ] if victim is responsive, they will attack the player
	- [ ] during chest compression, player will need to press a button on beat (120 bpm, up to 30 times if victim does not wake), with accompanying UI
		- [ ] motion controls? - 5 cm deep -  probably not though
		- ![[mad-rat-dead-beat-assist.png]]
	- [ ] followed by 2 rescue breath
		- [ ] pinch nose then blow into mouth - controls should reflect this in some way
	- [ ] followed by a shock
		- [ ] time the button press to line up with the right window
		- ![[undertale-attack-bar.png]]
- Wait
	- [ ] if victim is not breathing, they will die
	- [ ] maybe a minigame for waiting?
## stage 3
* [ ] After freeing a damaged victim, player must drag their rag-doll body to away from the hazard and position their body face up.
* [ ] Before resuscitation, player must remove armor from the victim
* [ ] Keep level select to be able to skip a section, but make the game continuous, possibly add rhythm based minigame for traversing dungeon
* [ ] When victims recovers, they leave behind an item which gives you a buff to help with some of the mechanics, ie, bigger time window to hit the beat or strength multiplier for mashing section

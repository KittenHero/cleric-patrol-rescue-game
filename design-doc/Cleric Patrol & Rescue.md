# Background:
You are a cleric on a pilgrimage through a dungeon to find the secret sauce.  You have no combat ability, but you know how to do CPR, and you have enough magic to act as a walking defibrillator every 2 minutes if you detect cardiac arrest.

# Overview

* [ ] Level select
* [ ] each level immediately transitions to where the victim is stuck
* [ ] the player mashes a button to fills up progress bar(s)
	* [ ] which interpolates the animation to free the victim
## stage 2

* [ ] Once freed, player is presented with the following options:
* [ ] Check for response
	- [ ] if victim is responsive, they will thank you
- [ ] ]Check breathing
	- [ ] hold the button to close your eyes and focus on the sound from the victim
	- [ ] if victim is responsive, they will ask what you're doing, but will thank you anyways
- Resuscitate
	- [ ] if victim is responsive, they will attack the player
	- [ ] during chest compression, player will need to press a button on beat (120 bpm, up to 30 times if victim does not wake), with accompanying UI
		- [ ] motion controls? - 5 cm deep

- Wait
	- [ ] if victim is not breathing, they will die

## stage 3
* [ ] After freeing a damaged victim, player must drag their rag-doll body to away from the hazard and position their body face up.
* [ ] Before resuscitation, player must remove armor from the victim
* [ ] Keep level select to be able to skip a section, but make the game continuous, possibly add rhythm based minigame for traversing dungeon
